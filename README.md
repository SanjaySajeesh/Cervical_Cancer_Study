# Cervical Cancer Dataset Study
## Dataset Description and Methodology

The Cervical Cancer dataset used in this project is extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Sobar, Machmund & Wijaya). It contains the data collected from 72 individuals and has 19 descriptive features and one target feature (ca_cervix). Upon analysing the raw data, there were no traces of Null values or whitespaces found. After satisfying all the data cleaning checklists, I did the analysis of the data provided. To analyse the data, there was a usage of python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and ScikitLearn.
